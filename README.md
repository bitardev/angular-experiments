# Angular Experiments

This is just a collection of experiments as I work through learning Angular + the JSON API for WordPress.

Each folder contains a basic theme with a different example or experiment.

For these examples to work, the [JSON REST API (WP API)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/) plugin must be installed (at least until it gets rolled into WordPress core).

## AE-1

This really basic example shows how to enqueue Angular, fetch 10 posts from the JSON API, and then output the title and excerpt from each post onto the page.
